        Good morning Have a profitable day ahead ðŸ’¯ ðŸ”¥


Global markets suggest a flat opening.
As i was expecting, markets fell more than 300 points from highs, and stucking at higher levels is painful, so i hope you're on the right side of the market.

We saw the break of 18200-18450 range yesterday on the downside, and some more profit booking can't be ruled out, so be cautious at higher levels.

Overall, the trend is positive until we're above 17800. Below, this level, trend will change.

Overall, market breadth is still on the negative side. That's why we're cautiously bullish and even going bearish near resistanceÂ levels.
